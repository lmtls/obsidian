"A one man army against the whole world"
A thousand souls who think the same
In closed of cells we lie unheard
Perhaps we're not so far away

Here comes the storm and storm is I
We blow the wick of devil's eye
Behold the sight of truth phenomenon
We long to build a novel pantheon

Piece by piece we piece together
Peaceful memories from the dust
Of love, of car, of contemplation
We find the seeds in barren lands

For those who fell in face of anger
And those who sunk beneath the pain
Hereby here grow The Gods of future
Your loss was not in fact for vain

Dismissed for long and lifted up
Our gods lie dormant in the dark
Bold hopes and dreams unrivaled
Are shining through, light sifts through cracks
