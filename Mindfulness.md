🧘‍♂️ Mindfulness is recognizing what is there in the present moment. Suffering is there, yes; but what is also there is that you are still alive: “Breathing in, I know I’m alive.” Your eyes still work: “Breathing in, I’m aware of my eyes. Breathing out, I smile to my eyes.”

⛩️ Mindfulness is an energy you can generate all day long through your practice. You can **wash your dishes in mindfulness**. You can **cook your dinner in mindfulness**. You can **mop the floor in mindfulness**. And with mindfulness you can touch the many conditions of happiness and joy that are already available. You are a real artist. You know how to create joy and happiness any time you want. This is **the joy and the happiness born from mindfulness**.
