**Identity, Faith, Evidence**

[[Mononoke Form, Truth, Reason]]
Three main pillars of self-perception(from my point of view). 
First, let's identify the baseline. What are we working with? We as living, conscious beings are inclined to absorb the things we consume. This data then is processed and perceived by us as an Identity that we hold on to. 
Example: I know that intelligent people read books -> I believe that I'm intelligent -> I absorb the identity of an intelligent person -> I act upon my newly found identity

Second, the most important piece is Faith. Faith does not have a rational explanation, oppositely it may even contradict logic and reasoning. For some time I was reluctant to believe something that does not seem real and missed out on a lot of opportunities. You know those self-help books, affirmations, and Metta meditation? Those seem to be based on this exact thing. They give you Faith, and they give you Hope for you to be able to accept that you are [insert good quality here]

Of course, we can't just live on mere predictions and daydreams, believes need to be supported. I'm not talking about blind Faith, so in order to fuel the engine, we need to have some results on which to depend. 
Let us return to the example again: I absorb the identity of an intelligent person -> I act upon my newly found Identity -> The action strengthens the belief of me being intelligent -> I reinforce the identity of an intelligent person

As we can see there is a self-repeating cycle that is created through those 3 concepts. I'm not stating that this one is perfect, just my observation with barely any research done. I would just be happy if it gives someone some insights.
