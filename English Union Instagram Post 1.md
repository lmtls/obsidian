Club Union association is happy to announce our new project - English Union!ðŸ¤© It is known that English is essential in the modern world and that it opens up infinite possibilities for a person. However, we understand that learning possibilities are fairly shallow for certain groups of people. Our mission is to provide a stable learning environment for children in need. The targetted audience of online (in-class after the pandemic) classes is orphanages and children's communities of Kazakhstan. We believe that everyone deserves a quality education no matter their situation and strive to build a place for learning, communicating, and sharing experiences with a focus on the English language. 
STAY TUNEDðŸŒŸ
