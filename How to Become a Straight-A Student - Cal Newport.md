# Part 1: Study Basics
   The pseudo-worker looks and feels like someone who is working hard—he or she spends a long time in the library and is not afraid to push on late into the night—but, because of a lack of focus and concentration, doesn’t actually accomplish much
-   **work accomplished = time spent x intensity of focus**
-   Most students, however, misunderstand the purpose of time management—they believe it’s used only to cram as much work as possible into the day. But this is not the main motivation behind controlling your schedule. As it turns out, a little planning goes a long way toward reducing your daily stress levels.

# Step 1: Time management system

## What do you need

-   Calendar (digital or analog) [Google Calendar]
-   List [Notion]

## Basic system

1.  Jot down new to-dos and appointments to the daily list
2.  At the start of the day transfer all of the stuff in the list to the calendar
3.  Choose today's appointments regarding their importance
4.  Transfer todays appointments into the list
5.  Try to plan the rest of the appointments in long term

## To-dos

-   Time label the to-dos
-   Do not overestimate your power(make appropriate time limits for voluminous tasks)

## Restarting after a period of neglect

1.  Jot down all the things to do and appointments in your head onto the paper
2.  Transfer them into the calendar

# Step 2: Declare war on procrastination

## Basic idea

You cannot completely destroy the urge to procrastinate. Some work is plain boring or too hard. Instead straight-A students don't hope on willpower and dedication, but rather deploy specific strategies and set of rules to minimize the bad habit.

## Battle plan #4: Build a routine

Find free one-hour session on each weekday to do the same task that is reocurring. For example, do your math problems at 06:00 every monday and thursday.

## Battle plan #5: Plan out the "Hard days"

Inevitably, you will have days when you humanly can't accomplish all of your school tasks and other stuff. We can't control it, but we can plan it ahead. If you see a big wave of deadlines coming from far you can structure your schedules to decrease their impact on you. For example, you can set your hard days on Saturday and tuesday, while Sunday and Wednesday will be more chill

# Step 3: When, Where and How long

## When?

Early. Do not leave your tasks yo the evening because you re most productive and willing to wirk between the time you wake up and dinner. Your schedule may be hectic and don't allow continuous stretches of work, so what you could do is to use this 30-45 minute breaks for your advance. Always be ready to get back to your material anytime that is free. After the dinner consider your workday over and chill all you want. **Remember its "Work hard, play hard" not "Work kind of hard, play kind of hard"**

## Where?

-   Try to spot the best isolated locations(preferably several) in order to always be near your studying spot.
-   Alternate them every now and then to keep your stimuli high.
-   Stay away from places that could highjack your workflow

## How long?

From 40minutes to 1.5 hours.


# Part 2: Quizzes and exams

# Step 1: Take Smart Notes

## Gather the Right Materials

Use your laptop for notes in general, its more efficient and organized.

Devote one notebook for technical courses (e.g. Mathematics, Physics)

Have a folder for each course where you can put all of your materials

## Non-technical cources

The key is to identify main ideas by the structure:

-   Question
-   Evidence
-   Conclusion

Do not get stuck in one place. Work simultaneously on several questions and several conclusions. You may make a mindmap connecting questions with conclusions through evidence.

### Format your notes aggresively

Theres no need to follow one structure. Your goal is that you from future can read and understand. **HIGHLIGHT,** underscore, _italize._ Basically anything that can help you read it later.

### Make the use of pauses

When teach/prof tells a personal story, someone asks simple question and etc. Use that time to clear up your notes and go through your questions.

### Reviewing your notes from a class

Take a little time vefore packung up to review your notes. That helps with memorizing.

### In the case of group discussion

-   Clearly identify a topic of discussion
-   If someone sais smth insightful jotbit down. If it doesnt resonate just ignore it
-   If you have an idea first jot it down and than present it to the class
-   Always listen if teach chimes in you better save their insight
