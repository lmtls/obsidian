By smiling for others I mean **making sure that your loved once feel your support in every step of the way**. Of course, if you are sad - cry. It's ok. But when you see someone who is suffering, try not to get swept away by suffering but understand the [[Annica(Impermanance)|fleeting nature of suffering]]. Always reasure those in need that **everything will be alright and there is no need to worry of a thing**.
