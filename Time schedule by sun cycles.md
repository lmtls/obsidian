# Sun cycle based time system
- Neurobiology research suggests that humans should wake up with the suns yellow rays and go to sleep at dawn when sun sets down
- Modern time system does not provide such opportunity, as seasonal changes affect the time of the sun cycles.
- For example:
6AM in the summer sun is up and person wakes up normally and goes to work
6AM in the winter sun is down and person reluctantly wakes up
- Why don't we make the system which works in regard to the sun cycles, not 24 hour cycles.
- Where is the problem with that?
