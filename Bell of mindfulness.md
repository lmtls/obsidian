⛩️ If you have a loved one who suffers, you can be a compassionate ally for him. You can offer to **sit with him** when he has to have a difficult conversation with somebody, either in person or over the phone. Every time the person he’s speaking with says something that you think might trigger your loved one’s anger or sadness, you can squeeze your loved one’s hand. That is your **bell of [[Mindfulness|mindfulness]]**. Say to your loved one ahead of time, “When you feel that squeeze, remember you don’t have to say anything. Take it as a reminder to breathe in and out three times slowly, paying attention to your breath. **[[Smile for others|Try to smile]]**. Maybe the person you are talking with will be very surprised by your **[[Understanding and listening to one another|quality of listening]]**. Just breathe in and out three times, don’t say anything, and try to smile.”
