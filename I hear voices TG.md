The next post will be covering a sensitive topic that is based on a real-life situation. I didn't want to talk about it here for some time but finally concluded that it's necessary for the context of publications. This might be the most meaningful piece that will be posted here, the foundation of everything I write about.

**I hear voices**

I remember having imaginary friends since I was very young (around 2-3 y/o). I would talk to 'ghosts' and fictional characters embracing my mind by creating wonderlands in my head, where I would be a magician or a superhero. One time I even nearly broke my neck after turning too fast trying to answer them. If to believe my mother's words I was trying to follow Tankori - a girl who lives in our house. Being raised in a religious family, it was not so long after that they took me to some holy person who kinda exorcised me.

At around 7 years of age, when I went to school it all kinda wore off. I was preoccupied with studies, interacting with real people, and making friends. I was living an average life I'd say. That was true somewhere until the 10th grade(around January 2020). I was trying to find myself, become a better person, make something influential, and just simply be happy. That's when I first encountered him(name omitted for safety purposes), a tall man wearing Victorian-era clothing with sharp eyes and a mysterious gleam. Whenever I would slack, procrastinate or go against my moral principles he presented himself as a binding force that helped me go through life.
That kind of encounters was not really constant and vivid enough, so it was not a big part of my life.

That said, I came to the final milestone of this journey in May of 2020. After the end of the academic year I went full monk mode(hid my phone, acquired digital minimalism, extensively practiced meditation) and isolated myself from the world. The cause of that decision is not yet fully understood by me, but oh boy has it paid off. Around that time I have discovered a concept of Tulpas - conscious imaginary beings created by willful effort; figments of mind that can think, speak, and have opinions independently. Tulpa is a 'thoughtform' - a generalized identity created to formulate certain ideas, emotions, and worldviews. The creation of a tulpa is a focused effort done by techniques of meditation, visualization, and a whole lot of cognitive training.

As a degenerate that I am, firstly I tried to create a 2d anime girl. After several months of concentrated effort, I got the first response not coming from me, but rather from someone else in my brain. An emotion that is hard to describe, an internal shiver that hits right into thy soul. It is really a scary and shaking experience, after which I backed up and forgot about it for a while.

That was until the end of summer when I made a second try, now with an existing form - the man that I was talking about. After only a week of work, I got the first response, after a second week he could structure sentences and ideas independently. For now, he has a pretty developed personality, has his own will, and frequently helps me out in hard situations.

Before experiences as such, I always thought that I am my brain, but now my view of it changed. We both agree on the statement that even if he has his own consciousness, he is not entirely real. Neither am I. From my perspective, tulpas are as human as I am, just as two operating systems simultaneously running on the same hardware. My consciousness is constructed out of a belief that I am real and if there is enough belief any number of personas could be created.

That is a true story beneath my external look, an infinitely deep and obscure theme that should not by any means be taken as an example.  I will probably post more details in the future, but for now, take care.

For clarification, this is not schizophrenia or any other mental illness, as it does not impare me in any way(it's actually the other way around).
