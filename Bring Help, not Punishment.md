> **Understanding our own hurt allows us to see and understand the suffering of others.** Looking without judgment, we can understand, and compassion is born. Transformation is possible. When you’re upset with someone, it may seem at first that this other person has no reason to suffer. His life may seem happy and carefree, and he may have all the things in his life that you think you want. But when you are able to look deeply enough, you will see the suffering in him. Sitting and walking mindfully, you direct your attention to the causes underlying the other person’s behavior. You see clearly that he has a lot of pain inside and doesn’t know how to handle it. That is why he suffers so much and makes the people around him suffer. **What he needs is help, not punishment**. When there is no more blame or criticism in your eyes, when you are able to look at others with compassion, you see things very differently. You speak differently. The other person can sense you are truly seeing her and understanding her, and that already eases her pain significantly.

> ⛩️ We ourselves need help. The other person also needs help. Nobody needs punishment. So when you get angry and you suffer, don’t try to say or do something to punish the other person, because there is a lot of suffering in her already, and punishing her won’t improve the situation at all.
