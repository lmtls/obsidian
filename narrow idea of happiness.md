Sometimes we think that 
*"Well someday I'll get this and that and then I'll be happy"*, but that's not true
We create these dreams, illusions that we cling onto. This is a very narrow view. It implies that we can be happy only in a certain singular condition.
**The truth is that we can be happy regardless of what conclusion a situation comes to**
