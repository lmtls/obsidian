## Battle Plan #1: Keep a work progress journal

Dedicate a simple journal for writing your tasks for the day in the morning and writing how many of that tasks did you complete throughout the day. In case if you didn't finish them you write the reason(most likely it will be a false ratonalization and other bs). Essentially, it's guilt tripping with extra steps.
