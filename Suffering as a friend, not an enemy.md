## ◆ Saying Hello

<aside> 🧘‍♂️ Breathing in, I know suffering is there. Breathing out, I say hello to my suffering.

> With mindful breathing, you can recognize the presence of a painful feeling, just like an older sibling greets a younger sibling. You can say, **“Hello, my suffering. I know you are there.”** In this way, the energy of mindfulness keeps us from being overwhelmed by painful feelings. We can even smile to our suffering and say, **“Good morning, my pain, my sorrow, my fear. I see you. I am here. Don’t worry.”**

> You can discover how, through looking deeply, you can transform this organic “garbage” into compost, which in turn may become many beautiful flowers of understanding, compassion, and joy.

> If you want to experience what the end of suffering will feel like, it is in the here and the now with this breath. **If you want nirvana, it’s right here.**
