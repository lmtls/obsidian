🧘‍♂️ _Waking up this morning I smile. I have twenty-four hours to live. I vow to live them deeply and learn to look at the beings around me with the eyes of compassion._

There are four lines. The first line is for your in-breath. The second line is for your out-breath. The third line is for your in-breath again. The fourth line is for your out-breath. As you breathe, you use the verse to focus your attention on the meaning of the words.
