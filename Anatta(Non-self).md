# Anatta(Non-self)
## One of the Three Universal Truths, as taught by [[00 Buddhism|The Buddha]]

What we call a Self isan illusion. Our consciousness is an [[Annica(Impermanance)|everchanging flow]] of [[Skandhas]]


# Heart Sutra
> When Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva was practicing the profound prajnaparamita, he illuminated the five skandhas and saw that they are all empty, and he crossed beyond all suffering and difficulty.
> Shariputra, 
> form does not differ from emptiness; emptiness does not differ from form. 
> Form itself is emptiness; emptiness itself is form. 
> So, too, are feeling, cognition, formation, and consciousness.
> Shariputra, all dharmas are empty of characteristics. 
> They are not produced. 
> Not destroyed, not defiled, not pure, and they neither increase nor diminish.
> Therefore, in emptiness there is no form, feeling, cognition, formation, or consciousness; 
> no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind; 
> no sights, sounds, smells, tastes, objects of touch, or dharmas; 
> no field of the eyes, up to and including no field of mind-consciousness; 
> and no ignorance or ending of ignorance, up to and including no old age and death or ending of old age and death. 
> There is no suffering, no accumulating, no extinction, no way, and no understanding and no attaining.
> Because nothing is attained, the Bodhisattva, through reliance on prajna paramita, is unimpeded in his mind. 
> Because there is no impediment, he is not afraid, and he leaves distorted dream-thinking far behind. 
> Ultimately Nirvana!
> All Buddhas of the three periods of time attain Anuttarasamyaksambodhi through reliance on prajnaparamita. Therefore, know that prajna paramita is a great spiritual mantra, a great bright mantra, a supreme mantra, an unequaled mantra. It can remove all suffering; it is genuine and not false. That is why the mantra of prajna paramita was spoken. 
> Recite it like this:
> 
> Gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha!

> Gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha!

> Gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha!
