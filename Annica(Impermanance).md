# Annica (Impermanance)
## One of the Three Universal Truths, as taught by [[00 Buddhism|The Buddha]]

As the life goes on its way karma works its way. Deeds are being done and those deeds have consequences attached to them. Being born is always in the ties with becoming dead. Wealthy become poor, ill become healthy, friends become lovers, family becomes enemies. Life is never constant and it shifts from form to form.
