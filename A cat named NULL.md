# A cat named NULL
- the cat is pitch black with sparkling eyes full of mystery (just as NULL value) it can become anything if it wants to. 
- I really relate to that cat cause I'm a NULL too, a blank piece of paper waiting to soak up or emmerge my true nature.
- Create a **story** about this cat **embracing** his nature *just like me*
- Black cats are considered unluckly, but he became the heart of the family.
