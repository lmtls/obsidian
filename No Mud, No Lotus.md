<aside> ⛩️ When you wake up in the morning, the first thing to do is to breathe and to become aware that you have twenty-four brand-new hours to live. This is a gift of life.

</aside>

> [[Waking up this morning I smile]]

> When we have **concentration**, we have a lot of **energy**. We won’t get carried away by visions of past suffering or fears about the future. We **dwell stably in the present moment** so we can get in touch with the wonders of life, and generate joy and happiness. Concentration is always concentration on something. If you focus on your breathing in a relaxed way, you are already **cultivating an inner strength.** When you come back to feel your breath, concentrate on your breathing with all your heart and mind. **Concentration is not hard labor.** You don’t have to strain yourself or make a huge effort. **Happiness arises lightly and easily.**

> Often, we just bite onto our **craving** or grudge, and let the hook take us. We get caught and **attached** to these situations that are not worthy of our concern. If **mindfulness and concentration** are there, then **insight** will be there and we can make use of it to swim away, free

> In the past we probably did suffer from one thing or another. It may even have felt like a kind of hell. If we remember that suffering, not letting ourselves get carried away by it, we can use it to remind ourselves, **“How lucky I am right now. I’m not in that situation. I can be happy.”—that is insight**

## ◆ Happiness Is Not an Individual Matter

<aside> ⛩️ We can borrow the **collective energy of mindfulness** of a group of practitioners, in order to recognize and embrace the block of suffering in us. When suffering has become a seemingly impenetrable obstacle, we can learn how to **draw on the support of others.**

</aside>

<aside> ⛩️ If we have loved ones who are suffering, one of the best things that we can do is to offer to sit or walk with them, and **offer them our energy of mindfulness and peace.** It can help calm them down and embrace their suffering, so that they can walk, sit, and breathe in mindfulness, and **take care of the crying baby inside them.** When you are truly there, you can go to the person you love, look into her eyes and say to her, “I am here for you.” **The most precious thing you can offer the person you love is your presence.** It’s not something you can buy in the supermarket.

</aside>

<aside> ⛩️ Anything you can do to lessen suffering in your community and in the world is known in Buddhism as **Right Action**. When you go to the supermarket, you can make the choice whether to practice Right Action or not. There are items for sale that have been produced by children who have no chance to go to school. There are items that have been made with materials that can be harmful. **We are part of the collective whole, and even these individual decisions about what to consume affect the collective consciousness**

<aside> 📜 On the day the Buddha became enlightened, he sat very quietly. Mara said, “Who is this guy sitting so quietly?” Mara didn’t disturb the Buddha; he just allowed the Buddha to sit. After sitting in meditation, the Buddha stood up and walked mindfully, freely, and peacefully. Mara asked, “Who are you? Why are you here?” The Buddha said, “I see that this Earth is a beautiful place; the scenery is lovely. The early morning is beautiful. The afternoon and the evening are beautiful. I see these wonders and it makes me so happy. I don’t need to have any possessions or wealth. I don’t need anything. All I need is the opportunity to sit still and to be able to walk on this beautiful planet.” Mara thought that this wasn’t a bad request. “Okay, you can sit as much as you want, walk as much as you want,” he said. A few days later, the Buddha asked, “I have a few friends. Actually I have 1,250 friends, and they all want to sit; they all want to walk in mindfulness. Can we have an area here to sit and walk mindfully and peacefully?” Mara said, “Sure, if you sit and walk, that’s fine. How much space do you want to have for practicing sitting meditation and walking meditation?” Back then they didn’t have fancy measuring devices. The Buddha said, “I have three robes. If you agree, I’ll take off my outer robe and I’ll throw it up in the sky as high as I can. The shadow cast on the Earth by my robe is the land I want to have for sitting, walking, and living mindfully.” Mara said, “Well the most it could be is just a few miles. Okay.” The Buddha rolled up his robe and threw it up in the sky. The robe went high, high, high up. Then it opened, and the shadow of the robe covered the whole planet. From then on, the Buddha and his students walked all over the Earth, practicing compassion and mindfulness and helping people suffer less. We all have the right to do the same on this planet, lessening suffering and increasing happiness. This Earth is not just the territory of Mara, but also the territory of the Buddha

<aside> 🧘‍♂️ _“Breathing in, I’m aware of the painful feeling in me. Breathing out, I’m aware of the painful feeling in me.”_ This is an art. We have to learn it, because most of us don’t like to be with our pain. We’re afraid of being overwhelmed by the pain, so we always seek to run away from it. There’s loneliness, fear, anger, and despair in us. Mostly we try to cover it up by consuming.

</aside>

<aside> ⛩️ “Darling, I know you suffer, and that is why I am here for you.” This is true love. True love is made of mindfulness.

</aside>

> According to the Buddha, a human being is made of five elements, called **skandhas** in Sanskrit. They are: form (body), feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness.

<aside> ⛩️ The Buddha observed, “The person who suffers most in this world is the person who has many wrong perceptions, and most of our perceptions are erroneous.” You see a snake in the dark and you panic, but when your friend shines a light on it, you see that it is only a rope. Please write beautifully the sentence, **“Are you sure?”** on a piece of paper and tape it to your wall.

</aside>

> **In wholesome love relationships, there is a certain amount of possessiveness and attachment, but if it’s excessive, both lover and beloved will suffer.** If a father thinks he “owns” his son, or if a young man tries to put restrictions on his girlfriend, then love becomes a prison.

<aside> 🧘‍♂️ **the first mindfulness training: reverence for life** _Aware of the suffering caused by the destruction of life, I am committed to cultivating the insight of interbeing, compassion, and learning ways to protect the lives of people, animals, plants, and minerals. I am determined not to kill, not to let others kill, and not to support any act of killing in the world, in my thinking, or in my way of life. Seeing that harmful actions arise from anger, fear, greed, and intolerance, which in turn come from dualistic and discriminative thinking, I will cultivate openness, nondiscrimination, and nonattachment to views in order to transform violence, fanaticism, and dogmatism in myself and in the world._

</aside>

<aside> 🧘‍♂️ **the second mindfulness training: true happiness** _Aware of the suffering caused by exploitation, social injustice, stealing, and oppression, I am committed to practicing generosity in my thinking, speaking, and acting. I am determined not to steal and not to possess anything that should belong to others; and I will share my time, energy, and material resources with those who are in need. I will practice looking deeply to see that the happiness and suffering of others are not separate from my own happiness and suffering; that true happiness is not possible without understanding and compassion; and that running after wealth, fame, power, and sensual pleasures can bring much suffering and despair. I am aware that happiness depends on my mental attitude and not on external conditions, and that I can live happily in the present moment simply by remembering that I already have more than enough conditions to be happy. I am committed to practicing Right Livelihood so that I can help reduce the suffering of living beings on Earth and reverse the process of global warming._

</aside>

<aside> 🧘‍♂️ **the third mindfulness training: true love** _Aware of the suffering caused by sexual misconduct, I am committed to cultivating responsibility and learning ways to protect the safety and integrity of individuals, couples, families, and society. Knowing that sexual desire is not love, and that sexual activity motivated by craving always harms myself as well as others, I am determined not to engage in sexual relations without true love and a deep, long-term commitment made known to my family and friends. I will do everything in my power to protect children from sexual abuse and to prevent couples and families from being broken by sexual misconduct. Seeing that body and mind are one, I am committed to learning appropriate ways to take care of my sexual energy and cultivating loving kindness, compassion, joy, and inclusiveness—which are the four basic elements of true love—for my greater happiness and the greater happiness of others. Practicing true love, we know that we will continue beautifully into the future._

</aside>

<aside> 🧘‍♂️ **the fourth mindfulness training: loving speech and deep listening** _Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful speech and the inability to listen to others, I am committed to cultivating loving speech and compassionate listening in order to relieve suffering and to promote reconciliation and peace in myself and among other people, ethnic and religious groups, and nations. Knowing that words can create happiness or suffering, I am committed to speaking truthfully, using words that inspire confidence, joy, and hope. When anger is manifesting in me, I am determined not to speak. I will practice mindful breathing and walking in order to recognize and to look deeply into my anger. I know that the roots of anger can be found in my wrong perceptions and lack of understanding of the suffering in myself and in the other person. I will speak and listen in a way that can help myself and the other person to transform suffering and see the way out of difficult situations. I am determined not to spread news that I do not know to be certain and not to utter words that can cause division or discord. I will practice Right Diligence to nourish my capacity for understanding, love, joy, and inclusiveness, and gradually transform anger, violence, and fear that lie deep in my consciousness._

</aside>

<aside> 🧘‍♂️ **the fifth mindfulness training: nourishment and healing** _Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful consumption, I am committed to cultivating good health, both physical and mental, for myself, my family, and my society by practicing mindful eating, drinking, and consuming. I will practice looking deeply into how I consume the Four Kinds of Nutriments, namely edible foods, sense impressions, volition, and consciousness. I am determined not to gamble, or to use alcohol, drugs, or any other products that contain toxins, such as certain websites, electronic games, TV programs, films, magazines, books, and conversations. I will practice coming back to the present moment to be in touch with the refreshing, healing, and nourishing elements in me and around me, not letting regrets and sorrow drag me back into the past nor letting anxieties, fear, or craving pull me out of the present moment. I am determined not to try to cover up loneliness, anxiety, or other suffering by losing myself in consumption. I will contemplate interbeing and consume in a way that preserves peace, joy, and well-being in my body and consciousness, and in the collective body and consciousness of my family, my society, and the Earth_

<aside> ⛩️ **Taking a step** and taking refuge in your step, means to stop running. For those of us who are used to always running, it is a revolution to make a step and stop running. **We make a step, and if we know how to make it, peace becomes available in that moment of touching the Earth with our feet.** When you breathe in, you may take two steps and say: _**“I have arrived, I have arrived.”**_ When you breathe out, you might like to take three steps and say: _**“I am home, I am home, I am home.”**_ “Home” means being at home in the present moment. Let your steps follow your breath, not the other way around. **Let your breathing be natural, never forced.** Breathing in, if your lungs want two steps, then we can take exactly two steps. If you feel better with three steps then give yourself three steps while breathing in. When you breathe out, listen to your lungs. Whenever you feel that you want to take an extra step while breathing out, then allow yourself to have one more step breathing out. **Every step should be enjoyable.**

</aside>

<aside> ⛩️ Practice **stopping while you’re walking**. If you can stop while walking, then you’ll be able to stop when doing your other daily activities, whether that is cleaning the kitchen, watering the garden, or eating breakfast.
