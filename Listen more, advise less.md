> 🧘‍♂ “Listening like this, my sole aim is to help the other person to suffer less. She may be full of wrong perceptions, but I won’t interrupt her. If I jump in with my perspective on things or correct her, it will become a debate, not a practice of deep listening. Another time, there may be a chance for me to offer her a little information so that she can correct her wrong perception. But not now.”

> “I know you have suffered a lot during the past many years. I was not able to help you to suffer less. Instead, I have made the situation worse. I have reacted with anger and stubbornness, and instead of helping you, I have made you suffer more. I am very sorry.” Many of us are no longer able to use that kind of language with the other person because we have suffered so much. But when we **consciously practice deep listening and loving speech, so much healing and happiness is possible.**"

⛩️ When you look at the person you love, if he or she is absorbed in anxiety, you can help that person to get out. _**“Darling, do you see the sunset? Do you see the spring coming?”**_ This is [[Mindfulness|mindfulness]]. Mindfulness is for making us aware of what is happening now. Not only are there always conditions of **happiness present in me**, but they are **also all around me**.
