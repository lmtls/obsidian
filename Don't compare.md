> Equality, when it refers to opportunity and access to resources, in other words treating everyone’s needs and feelings with respect, is a good thing. But the constant effort to prove one’s self equal to all others brings only short-lived relief from the pain of discrimination—and, ultimately, creates more suffering because it perpetuates our incorrect belief in a separate self.
