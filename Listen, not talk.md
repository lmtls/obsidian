⛩️ The most effective way to show compassion to another is to **listen, rather than talk.** You have an opportunity to practice deep, compassionate listening. If you can listen to the other person with compassion, your listening is like a salve for her wound. In the practice of compassionate listening, **you listen with only one purpose, which is to give the other person the chance to speak out and to suffer less.**

> [[Listen more, advise less]]
