For the world inside and world outside
I wish you clarity and sight
To see the wonder in yourself
And bring thou peace with fiery might

To see the wonder of the world
In most everythin you see
With eyes full of passion and compassion
Quite like the starry skies at night

To hear the music of the sun
To feel the wind blow on your skin
With Earth we're born, with Earth we'll go
Be there for them and them for you.
