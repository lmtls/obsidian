[[GPPW Paper]]
- When you work on part 2, the debate and perspective of experts - be sure to explain the argument given in the expert's texts: given that an argument is a set of reasons for a conclusion, you must be sure to, first, paraphrase the conclusion given in the text. Don't pick some random part of the middle. Look for the heading - conclusion - or indicating words or phrases - 'we conclude' etc..
- Also, see the keyword - 'experts' 
- so, the sources for the introduction should be people who are experts in the topic; so - no blogs, newspaper articles, etc.; experts write in peer reviewed journals and have specialised degrees in the topic. So, be careful what sources you choose for this part.
