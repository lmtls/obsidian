# Consciousness (Vijnana)
## Final of other skandhas. 
When six faculties reach their objects and when perception is formed Vijnana arises. *(e.g. aural consciousness arises from ear and sound)*
> However, it is important to note that Consciousness is not **[[Sensation]]**, nor is it **[[Perception]]**. It's main function is awareness, which is not reaction(Perception) and not a sensation.
