Oh, to be a mighty eagle
To see sunrises up horizon
Be it summer or the winter season
I don't care, I fly away (so high)

Oh, to be a mountain eagle
Sun shines brightly in the sky
Be it summer or the winter season
I don't care, I fly away (so high)

Take your both feet off the ground
Take yourself up from the shore
Take somebody
Take somebody with you
Cause we'll need some people
